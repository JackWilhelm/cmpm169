				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Watch the Book of Genesis play out before you eyes. Edit the story and see how it changes the path of the beginning of time.</p>
				<p>ESC - pause/unpause</p>
				<p>How to use find and replace - enter the word/phrase/characters you want to swap out in the upper text box. Enter the what you want them to be
					replaced with in the lower textbox. Press F2. Press ESC, the ESC again to see your results. For example you can swap out every instance of the word God with Mario.
				</p>
				<p>While paused:</p>
				<p>Type - Inserts text into the story whwever the index is.</p>
				<p>Left and right arrows - move index left and right.</p>
				<p>Left ctrl - put index at start of story.</p>
				<p>up and down arrow - zoom in and out</p>
				<p>click and drag - move around canvas</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Every frame a character from the Book of Genesis is added onto another string called textTyped. This text is then printed out accordingly. Punctuation and spaces are displayed as twists
					and turns and moves the canvas accordingly to keep the progress centered. Only the previous 1000 charcters are printed in unpause mode to be more efficient. Pauseing and editing the text will recalculate the twists and turns 
					to display an new path. 
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Jack Wilhelm - A lot of math and trial and error went into this project making it very exhausting but fun to watch. Still staying one of the hardest parts was keeping track of the spaces because spaces are a 50/50 chance to turn left or right
					and thus when recalculating all of those turns have to be properly tracked so the path properlly recreates itself as thought those changes had always existed. I think the concept of tracking the Christian origin story as the beginning of time and see how things could be changed 
					is an interesting butterfly effect view of the creation of the world and man.
