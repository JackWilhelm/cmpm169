				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Based on the size of the canvas, a 3D array is created representing different coordinates. Then an array representing a path attempts to walk as far as possible without running
					into itself by checking all possible neighbors. If there are no options, then the path ends. Each frame, this path is reconstructed using cubes and lines. As this path is being drawn out
					the path the starting value of the path is also being shifted out to make the path appear to be shrinking.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Jack Wilhelm - This project was a lot more difficult especially when finding something to base it off of. I'm slowly becoming the Jackson Pollock of random walks as I continue to find 
					there behaviors interestings. This project took a lot of effort when wrapping my head around thinking of a 3D dimension on a 2D canvas but I eventually got the job done.
