				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>You are gazed upon shameful eyes unwillingy to look at you if your too close. Be careful not to disturb them.</p>
				<p>up/down cursors = increase/decrease minimum eye size</p>
				<p>click = disturb the eyes</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Based on <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_2_1_1_04">this work</a>
				where it displays a grid of images each rotated based on the mouses position. Each image rotates to face towards or away from the mouse 
			using a lerp based on the distance between the mouse and the eye. It then shakes be translating it a random degree on the x and y axis based on a given 
		shake magnitude and distance. Clicking to disturb the eyes increases this shake magnitude as it slow comes down to a base value over time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Jack Wilhelm - The process behind this project involved a lot of lerps, distance tracking, and math. Due to the difficulty tracking and images current position after translation, it was difficult to make further distance based calculations. After playing around with the math and giving a lot of the variables maximum and minumum values to control the projects feel, it really came together.</p>
