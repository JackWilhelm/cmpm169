				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project aims to imitate the odd ways wolf packs move in and around each others territories.</p>
				<p>q, w, e = decrease, reset, and increase the size of each territory spot.</p>
				<p>a, s, d = decrease, reset, and increase the distance a wolf can travel in one go.</p>
				<p>z, x, c = decrease, reset, and increase the amount of wolves in each pack.</p>
				<p>i, o, p = decrease, reset, and increase the range each wolf can smell/see.</p>
				<p>n = make packs start in random places.</p>
				<p>m = make packs start in preset places.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>At the start of the program, a 2d array "world" is set up to represent the various
					points on the screen. Each pack is then filled with wolves that track their own x and y coordinates. Each loop, for each pack, the stroke is set to that packs
					color and for each wolf in that pack they move pased on certain rules. Each wolf places a spot in its current spot and 2 temp variables hold onto their old x and y.
					Each wolf then attempts to move to a new spot. A wolf succesfully moves to a spot if A: that spot is unclaimed and B: the wolf randomly decides to move to it based on the 
					presense of nearby spots of other packs. The more presense, the less likely it will move their. If a wolf succesfully moves to a spot, it will draw a line between its 
					old spot and new spot. If not, the wolf does not move until the next loop.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Jack Wilhelm - This project was a doozy. Starting with a random walk was easy, but it slowly got more difficult. After that I allowed the packs to have multiple wolves which required me to 
					set up a lot of loops to move each one. Then I tried fidgiting with the distance they go and the size of the world which had some of its own math issues. The hardest part was implementing the math 
					behind detecting the presense of other pack spots, and making the chance of moving less likely with higher presence. It took a lot of number crunching and graphing but I eventually landed upon something cool and different.
