				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Watch how the distribution of Magic the Gatherings card colors and types change over the years. The graph on the left shows the distribution
					of colors over each year based on the type of card. The bubble graph shows the distribution of card colors and types. The squares on the right represetn 5 cards of each color in that year.
				</p>
				<p>S - change card type</p>
				<p>Left/Right arrow - change year</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using Scryfall's API, data for each year of magic since its start in 1993 is pulled and sorted by color and type. This data is then represented by percents and fed into an arc graph. Using the numbers of each color and
					type without converting it to percents results in the data for the bubble chart. And lastly the data for the squares is each color gets a square for every 5 cards of that color during that year.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Jack Wilhelm - Juggling all my responsibilities I luckily found just enough time to get this project done. I dove into graphing and Scryfalls API's to represent one of my favorite hobbies. After struggling with 
					the D3.js program I was able to get some interesting anad interactable graphs and charts that satisfied my needs.
