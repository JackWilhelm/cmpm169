				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Watch as many triangles paint some of the most famous pieces of art. Each piece is composed
					of multiple Walkers moving around the screen generating color triangles based on famous paintings.
				</p>
				<p>W = Increase alpha</p>
				<p>S = Decrease alpha</p>
				<p>Z = White edges</p>
				<p>X = No edges</p>
				<p>C = Black edges</p>
				<p>Left Arrow = Decrease maximum triangle size</p>
				<p>Right Arrow = Increase maximum triangle size</p>
				<p>Click = Change painting</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>First, an array of triangles is created. Each triangle consists of 3 x,y coordinates. Next a 2D array (called world) is created to represent the canvas to monitor how recently a new point was added to each area. In each loop for each triangle, one of the coordinates
					is picked at random to be changed. The new point is based on the midpoint of the other 2 coordinates plus or minus a random amount up/down/left/right. Before this 
					new coordinate is locked in, it must check the world array to see if the point it is trying to take has recently been affected. If so, the new coordinate is not implemented. If a point on the array has been left alone longer enough
					(a couple of frames) then the new point can be implemented and that point (and other nearby points) are set to be unclaimable for a couple of frames.
					The color of the triangle is based on the location of its centroid (center of the triangle). With the centroid coordinate calculated, it gets the color of the respective pixel
					from a famous painting. The user is able to affect a triangles alpha, maximum size, and stroke color as well as change which painting the triangles are trying to replicate.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Jack Wilhelm - This project went pretty smoothly. Interested in Random Walks from the last project I wanted to continue that but evolve it a little to be random walking triangles
					rather than just simple points. The implementation of tracking moving triangles was pretty straight forward but there were some difficulties managing that canvas size to properly fit the painting with its various sizes.
					I did run into some problems with my computer crashing because of the high workload, but by reducing the world array sizes and number of walkers, I was able to make a fast and effective program that prints really interesting pieces.
